[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gabrysbiz/lesscss-compiler.svg?branch=feature%2F2.0)](https://travis-ci.org/gabrysbiz/lesscss-compiler)

The LessCSS Compiler is a Java library which compiles [Less](http://lesscss.org/) source files to [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) code.

From [Less](http://lesscss.org/) website:
> Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables,
> mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable
> and extendable.

# Compatibility
The compiler is compatible with version [1.7.5](https://github.com/less/less.js/releases/tag/v1.7.5).
The library is based on the official [Less](http://lesscss.org/) JavaScript compiler adapted to the
[Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino) engine.

# Requirements
The compiler to run requires:
* Java 6.0 or higher
* Third-Party Dependencies ([see list](http://lesscss-compiler.projects.gabrys.biz/LATEST/dependencies.html))

# Download
You can download the library from [this page](http://lesscss-compiler.projects.gabrys.biz/LATEST/download.html)
or using various [dependency management tools](http://lesscss-compiler.projects.gabrys.biz/LATEST/dependency-info.html).

# Concept
The idea for the `LessCompilerImpl` class was based on the [lesscss-java](https://github.com/marceloverdijk/lesscss-java)
library by [Marcel Overdijk](https://github.com/marceloverdijk).
